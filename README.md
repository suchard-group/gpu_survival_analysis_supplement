# Massive Parallelization of Massive Sample-size Survival Analysis
This repository contains the instructions and files to reproduce the experiments performed in the "Massive Parallelization of Massive Sample-size Survival Analysis" paper by Yang et al.


### Reproducing the experiments in Section 3

* `runFixedL1Both.R` reproduces the synthetic experiments in Section 3.2.

* `runAutoL1Both.R` reproduces the synthetic experiments in Section 3.3.

* `runLEGEND.R` reproduces the LEGEND study in Section 3.4. Note that we are unable to provide access to the Optum de-identified Electronic Health Records due to data licensing constraints. However, we provide the cohorts definition `cohortsDefinition.pdf` that can reproduce our real-world analysis for reader who do license the Optum de-identified Electronic Health Records data source.
